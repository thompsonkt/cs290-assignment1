Hobbies and interests: 
In my spare time, I enjoy activities like golf in the summer and skiing/snowboarding in the winter time. I also enjoy travel. To relax, I'll watch a movie or catch up on a favorite TV show like Walking Dead or something on Netflix.

Programming background: 
I have worked in IT for the last 10 years as an analyst, developer and project manager. Over the course of that period I coded projects in Coldfusion, VB.net and Oracle PL/SQL.
